# FizzGUI

FizzGUI is an OpenGL GUI for [Fizzle][fizzle] engine, —Åonstructed from [EweyGewey][EweyGewey], but reworked crucially. 


UNDER CONSTRUCTION
==================

At present, it is very much in an alpha stage with new development adding in
features, widgets and possibly API breaks. Any API break should increment the
minor version number and any patch release tags should remain compatible even
in development 0.x versions.

Screenshots
-----------

Here's some of what's available right now in the [example][example]:

![screenshot][screenshot]


Requirements
------------

* [Mathgl][mgl32] - for 3d math
* [Freetype][freetype] - for dynamic font texture generation
* [Fizzle][fizzle] - provides an OpenGL 3/es2/es3 abstraction
* [GLFW][glfw] (v3.1) - currently GLFW is the only 'host' support for input


Differences
-----------

* Windows were replaced on Containers, containers can not be moved and do not have a title, scrollbars(current) are not available too.
* Containers may create various widgets, widgets are placed one by one, if there is no enough space in row, widget moves to the new row(in html it looks like a *float*).
* Widget may have a fixed position
* Smart layout system for positioning of containers and widgets 
* Some widgets may have callbacks(signals) calling on appropriated events(ex: press button)


Current Features
----------------

* Containers
    * Text
    * Input text
    * Button
    * Checkbox
    * Progressbar
    * Images
    * Drag and Drop system


TODO
----

The following need to be addressed in order to start releases:

* more widgets:
    * text wrapping
    * multi-line text editors
    * combobox
* editbox cursor doesn't start where mouse was clicked
* and more other
